# RiVEC Bencmark Suite

## Overview

The RiVEC Benchmark Suite is a collection composed of data-parallel applications from different domains. The suite focuses on benchmarking vector microarchitectures. Current implementation is targeting RISC-V Architectures; however, it can be easily ported to any Vector/SIMD ISA thanks to a wrapper library which we developed to map vector intrinsics and math functions to the target architecture.

The benchmark suite with all its applications and input sets is available as open source free of charge. Some of the benchmark programs have their own licensing terms which might limit their use in some cases.

RiVEC implements the lastest riscv intrinsics for rvv-1.0. It can be compiled with the latest [riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain). RiVEC has been successfully tested on Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator, qemu RISC-V System emulator, and gem5 simulator.

There is also an implementation based on the Working draft of the proposed RISC-V V vector extension v0.7. Click [here](https://github.com/RALC88/riscv-vectorized-benchmark-suite/tree/rvv-0.7).

## Building the rv64gcv baremetal toolchain with LLVM

To compile the suite it is required to install the [RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain] (https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain). Next lines summarizes the commands to build the rv64gcv baremetal toolchain with LLVM. We strongly recommend to look at the official toolchain repository for more details.


Set the installation PATH 
```
export RISCV="/your_path/build/riscv"
export PATH="$RISCV:$PATH"
```

Cloning the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
```

Install dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 python3-pip libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev ninja-build git cmake libglib2.0-dev libslirp-dev
```

Install RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain 
```
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=$RISCV --enable-llvm --disable-linux --with-arch=rv64gcv --with-cmodel=medany
make -j37 all build-sim SIM=qemu
```


### The RISC-V vector C intrinsics 

As mentioned above, RiVEC implements the lastest riscv intrinsics for rvv-1.0.  RISC-V vector C intrinsics provide users interfaces in the C language level to directly leverage the RISC-V "V" extension.  More details can be found [here] (https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/blob/main/doc/rvv-intrinsic-spec.adoc).

Here a nice instrinsic viewer tool https://dzaima.github.io/intrinsics-viewer

### Setting up the environment

The Suite includes a makefile to compile every application, in order to use it, you must define the path to the RISC-V vector compiler.

Setting the Vector Compiler path
```
export RISCV="/your_path/build/riscv"
export PATH="$RISCV:$PATH"
```

### Compile using  clang for RISCV Vector Version

To compile any application run the command make followed by the application name
```
make application 
```
For example to compile blackscholes:
```
make blackscholes 
```
The same for the other applications ...

Also you can compile all the applications by typing:
```
make all 
```

### Running applications on Spike

All the RiVEC applications can run on [Spike] (https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim).  We strongly recommend to look at the official Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator repository for more details.

Install Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator
```
sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler libboost-regex-dev libboost-system-dev
git clone https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim.git
cd riscv-isa-sim/
mkdir build
cd build/
../configure --prefix=$RISCV --with-arch=rv64gcv
make -j17
make install
```

Once you have installed Spike you can run the following commands to run an applicaiton.
```
$RISCV/bin/spike --isa=rv64gcv pk _axpy/bin/axpy_vector.exe "256"
```

### Running applications on Qemu

When building the rv64gcv baremetal toolchain with LLVM with the above provided commands, it was indicated to also install QEMU


Running Axpy:
```
RISCV/bin/qemu-riscv64 -L $RISCV/sysroot ./_axpy/bin/axpy_vector.exe "256"
```

### Running applications

There are provided 5 different simulation sizes (arguments to run the application).
```
simtiny : takes seconds to be executed on gem5
simsmall : takes around 15-30 minutes to be executed on gem5
simmedium : takes around 1-2  hour to be executed on gem5
simlarge : takes around 8-24 hours to be executed on gem5
native : only for native hardware
```

Whe you are executing an application, you must write the following arguments to run a predefined simsize.
