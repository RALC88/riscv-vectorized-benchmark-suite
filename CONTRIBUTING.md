If you've made changes to RiVEC Bencmark Suite that might benefit others, we strongly encourage
you to contribute those changes to the public RiVEC Bencmark Suite repository. There are
several reasons to do this:
 * Share your work with others, so that they can benefit from new functionality.
 * Support the scientific principle by enabling others to evaluate your
   suggestions without having to guess what you did.
 * Once your changes are part of the main repo, you no longer have to merge
   them back in every time you update your local repo. This can be a huge time
   saving!
 * Once your code is in the main repo, other people have to make their changes
   work with your code, and not the other way around.
 * Others may build on your contributions to make them even better, or extend
   them in ways you did not have time to do.
 * You will have the satisfaction of contributing back to the community.

New vectorized applications are welcome. We strongly encourage you to contribute with new apps to 
enrich the scenarios and diversity in the RiVEC Bencmark Suite.
